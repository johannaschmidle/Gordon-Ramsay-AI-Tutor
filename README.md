## How it works
### AI Tutor 

I have created three versions 
1. **Basic**: This is just the plain code in a python environment
2. **Medium**: This is similar logic code to basic but I have used the python _panel_ library to make an interactive chat window
3. **App**: I used a streamlit template to create an app that is hosted online so you do not have to download and run the code yourself. You can just try the app version
   
## Basic Version
- Add a file called "ApiKey.txt" that holds your own personal API key to the same file on your computer
- When you want to use the AI tutor just run all the code blocks and respond to the prompts
- When you wish to **stop**, just type quit into the text box and you will exit the chat
  
## Medium Version
- The usage is similar to the previous version
- Add a file called "ApiKey.txt" that holds your own personal API key to the same file on your computer
- When you want to use the AI tutor just run all the code blocks and the code will create a new window with the interactive chat display
- When you wish to **stop**, just exit the window
